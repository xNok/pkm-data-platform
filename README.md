# Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Data Platform

Data Pipeline and Tools for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

## Why?
I am a big Notion user, but also a software developer, so using Notion I would like to automate quite a few tasks. I know I could use the API, or use tools like Zapier or IFTTT. However, all those solutions don't rely simplify my life. No code platforms are fairly tedious to set up and limited in their free plan.

Knowledge is data. So why not used a data approach to the problem? Extracting the information, transforming it and loading it into another database that best represents the hidden model I use in my notion workspace. Once the data is processed, queries should be easier and adding know tools to my ecosystem should be simple as well.

The dream would be to never be locked by any vendor and have my copy of all my notes and whatever else.
